The project is the Dequeue algorithm which is an interface. 

The project is an example of how the algorithm works with a real life scenario of lines.

This project requires that you know basic Java. One should have taken a few programming courses before doing this algorithm.

If you need help, either message me at aahmed58@nyit.edu, or search a youtube video on how to do it. Please don't spam me. I will do my best to get back to your message as soon as I can.
